  I have completed an apprenticeship and created a project of RS232 to
  RS485 converter for the department of service with which I was
  working. I learned that the department of production may sometimes be
  situated in the same country but in another city, which can result in
  a long lag for correction of design. Therefore, I should always verify
  my project in the simulator.}
